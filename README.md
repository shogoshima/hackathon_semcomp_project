TODO: explicar resumidamente a plataforma, de forma mais ludica para quem nao mexe tanto com termos tecnicos

The host just have to fill the forms with a few specifications regarding the event such as **local, time, target pulic, duration and so on**. Then, our API, which is integrated with the solutions offered by *Cohere*, generates a series of customized prompts from those inputs to feed a text generation model, which is responsible for responding with a lot of recommendations about genre, songs, playlists, useful links and so on.
